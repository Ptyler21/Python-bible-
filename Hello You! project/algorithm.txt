What I would like the program to do 

1. Ask the user for their name,age,city, and hobby

2. store each of those into variables

3. form a sentence unique to any individual 

	-ideally name,age,city,hobby

	-there will be a base string that returns 
		- "H1 {name} you are {age} years old, living in {city} and you like {hobby} 
	
	-how to insert str variables into a string? 
		-.format method 
		-c = input("give me a name")
		"blah {1}".format(c)
