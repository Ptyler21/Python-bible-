Desired state of the program 

1. generate the health amount of the potion 
	How to generate the random amount of Health? 
	a. using the random module for python 
	specifically a random integer so, something like:
 
	healthPotionAmount = random.randint(1,100) 
	
	b.The amount of health lowers depending on the level	
	
	easyPotionAmount = random.randint(50,100)
	mediumPotionAmount = random.randint(25,75) 
	hardPotionAmount = random.randint(1,20) 

	-then simply return all three of these in a function
2. The character 
	
	No specific restriction on character variables
	-nees a minimum of a name & an amount of health
	a. variable for name
	name = "Bob" 
	
	b. variable for health
	
	-The variable can also be random to save the hassle
	
	c. how to add the potion health to the characters current health
	
	-the difficulty needs to be set 
	-the name can be made by input to the program
	-health at start could also be set or randomized 
	
	something like this for a template:

        def markup(name,health,diff):

  print(str(name),int(health),str(diff))



def main():
    markup("mark",22,"hard")

	
3. Difficulty
	The potion will give less amount of health at higher levels 
	- looking for a way to give the character less and less health from the potion
