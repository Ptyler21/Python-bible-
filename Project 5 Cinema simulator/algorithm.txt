what I would like the program to do:

1. users choose from a range of films

-the films need to be stored in a data structure
-each film has an age limit and seating limit
-the films could be stored in a dictionary
	-the movies would be the key
	-the 1st value would be the age limit
	-the second value could be the seat limit
		-a second dictionary could be made of movie: {"age":int,"seat":int}

2. then the program ask then for their age

3. if they are old enough and if there are enough seats the user can watch the film

4. if they are not old enough then they get a message telling them this

5. if there are not enough seats then the user should pick another movie
