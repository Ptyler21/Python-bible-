What I would like for the program to do: 

1. Ask the user for their email address 
	i.e (Email = input("Please give your Email address"))
2. Slice the email for the user name 
	userName = Email[:@] 
3. Slice the email for their domain name 
	domainName = Email[@:]
4. there will be an output message telling the user their username and domain name 
	outPut = "Your username is {0} and your domain is {1}".format(userName,domainName)
