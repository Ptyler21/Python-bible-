vowels: a e i o u,y 

constanants: everything else

what I would like the program to do: 

look through a sentence for words that start with vowels or constanants

if they are found convert them to pig latin form 

if the word starts with a vowel simply add yay to the end of the word 

if the word starts with a consonant move the first two letters to the end 
and ad yay
