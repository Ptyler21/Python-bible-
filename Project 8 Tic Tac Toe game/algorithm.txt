What I would like the program to do:

1. The program will ask the user if they wish to be x or o
 -if the user picks x then their specfic variable is x
2. the program will then ask the user to pick a spot on the board
  -the icon that the user chose will then be put in place
3. The program will then also choose a spot.
  -it must be a spot that the player isn't already in

win condition
1. the player should be able to win if they get three pieces in corresponding
spaces.
2. the Ai should win with the same method
