This project is meant to simulate a crazy security system. 
There will be a list of known usernames. Every time the program runs it will ask 
you for a name. if the name is in the list it will print a welcome message and ask if you want to be removed from the list. 
if your name is not found to be in the list it will ask if you would like to be added.
