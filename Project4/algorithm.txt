What I would like for the program to do: 

1. have a list prepopulated users 

2. ask the user for a name 

3. check if the name is IN the list 

4. if the name is in the list notify the user 

	-ask the user if they would like to delete the name 
	-if yes, then call the remove element 
	-if no, move on to the end of the program 

5. if the name is not in the list
	-ask the user if they would like to add the name
	-if yes, call the list.append method 
	-if no, move on to the end of the program
